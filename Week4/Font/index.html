Lyrics
Seven a.m.,
The garbage truck beeps as it backs up
And I start my day thinking about what I've thrown away.
Could I push rewind?
The credits traverse signifying the end but I missed the best part.
Could we please go back to start?
Forgive my indecision
Then again, you're always first when no one's on your side.
But then again, a day will come when I want off that ride.
Eleven a.m.,
By now you would think that I would be up
But my bedsheets shade the heat of choices I've made.
And what did I find?
I never thought I could want someone so much
'Cause now you're not here and I'm knee deep in
That old fear.
