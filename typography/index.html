        Seven a.m.,
The garbage truck beeps as it backs up
And I start my day thinking about what I've thrown away.
Could I push rewind?
The credits traverse signifying the end but I missed the best part.
Could we please go back to start?
    </p>
    <p>
        Forgive my indecision
        Then again, you're always first when no one's on your side.
        But then again, a day will come when I want off that ride.

        Eleven a.m.,
        By now you would think that I would be up
        But my bedsheets shade the heat of choices I've made.
        And what did I find?
        I never thought I could want someone so much
        'Cause now you're not here and I'm knee deep in
        That old fear.
